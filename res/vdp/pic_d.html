Basicaly, a plane is a big array (a 512px*512px plane is a 64*64 cases array. Aka PlaneData). In each case, you can specify:<BR>
1-Priority (HP or LP).<BR>
2-Palette (0-3).<BR>
3-Flip (V,H,HV).<BR>
<Font color="red">4-Id of the starting tile (0-2047).</FONT><BR>
It's a bit like sprites, but here, you can specify 1 independant tiles / case of the plane.<BR>
<B>You must define the order of tiles on the plane yourself</B>.<BR>
In the fallowing example, the complete font tiles are stored in the VRAM (pattern).<BR>
And when the program reload the plane with *text* it just put: A=1,B=2,C=3....<BR>
Infact, when the letter A is used 3 times or more in the text, it's a bit like a clone (in the PlaneData, not in the pattern). <BR>
<FOnt color="green">This *cloning* technique is used in 99% of the games to save VRAM pattern space. Because, when you want to display a full screen pic, it's 40*28 tiles (1120 tiles) and this is enormous to store  in the VRAM (the pattern).</font><BR>

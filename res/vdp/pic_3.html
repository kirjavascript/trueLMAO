Jamit shows something very interresting : The use of tiles priorities to create a 3rd scroll plane. <BR>
If you look carefuly : PlaneA = House, Wall, Basket court. PlaneB = Background, Radio+Barrels, Wooden wall.<BR>
<Font color="red">The wooden wall (PlaneB) is in HP and the Basket court (PlaneA) is in LP so the tiles from PlaneA are displayed behind the tiles from PlaneB.</Font><BR>
You may notice that the shadow (due to a LP tiles in PlaneA) only occurs when PlaneB is in LP too (on the house & top wall for exemple).<BR>
Other notice : Since the BasketCourt is small, Planes's content doesn't need to be reloaded dynamicaly during scroll (all is loaded at the game start and no more after).<BR>
<Font color="green">Just for the info : Planes size are 64*64 tiles (max size) and Shadow/Highlight is activated.</FONT>

16:24:54 < Jorge> A10000 region only goes upto A1001F
16:25:29 < Jorge> it has the version register followed by the port1/2/3 controls & data
16:26:09 < Jorge> A10020 doesn't give you data acknolewdge, so the system just hangs
16:27:27 <%snkenjoi> just by reading it?
16:27:33 < Jorge> or writing it
16:27:39 < Jorge> it's basically touch and die

16:28:21 <%snkenjoi> what about if you try writing to the version addr
16:28:26 <%snkenjoi> hang or ignore?
16:28:39 < Jorge> 99% sure nothing will happen

16:49:22 < Jorge> many old MD emulators are what something called "line emulators"
16:49:35 < Jorge> they render a line
16:49:43 < Jorge> line is 3420 cycles
16:50:02 < Jorge> >run CPU for 3420 / 7 cycles
16:50:09 < Jorge> (basically)
16:50:36 < Jorge> exodus is a cycle emulator, meaning that every cycle it evaulates everything
16:51:54 <%snkenjoi> a line being a horizontal interrupt?
16:51:59 < Jorge> no, a video line

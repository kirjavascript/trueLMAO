As you can see, Aladdin use some very basic VDP techniques. PlaneA is foreground (with buildings), PlaneB is background (with scrolling clouds & dunes), and Sprites are over all.<BR>
The PlaneB seems to scroll infinite and the PlaneA is reloaded when scrolling (since the levels are larger than 64*32 tiles).<BR>
<Font color="green">Just to inform : Shadow/Highlight mode is disactivated and plane size are 64*32 tiles.</font>

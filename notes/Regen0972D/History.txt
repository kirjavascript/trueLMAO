Version 0.972
-------------
I hate to make releases so quickly but I have to since there was a bug left
in the EEPROM code that could cause some games to fail.

* Fixed a bug in EEPROM code which caused NBA Jam Tournament Edition to crash.


Version 0.971
-------------
This is a quick maintenance release mainly to fix some stability issues.
The internal version number of Regen executable hasn't been changed so that
the previous localization DLLs will keep working for this new release as well since
it is mainly a bug fix release. It is recommended however that translators update
their translations for this new release as it add few stuff as well.

* Fixed localization DLL not being loaded correctly sometimes and converted some 
  ANSI parts to Unicode internally.

* Fixed Regen crashing when loading a Genesis game after SMS/GG.

* Fixed Regen crashing when SuperHQ is toggled during SMS/GG.

* Fixed Regen crashing when Save/Load State As was selected.

* Fixed Regen SSE2 optimized build crashing on Athlon64.

* Fixed UAC related crashes on Windows Vista/7.

* Fixed Sonic 3D Blast crashing in bonus stage.

* Fixed CRAM viewer in the VDP debugger.

* Altered 68k and VDP timings a little bit. Fixes the Street Racer background 
  (sky) gradient.

* Added configurable lowpass filtering. Its only avaialable in SuperHQ mode.
  It configures the internal filtering applied when in HQ mode. The other
  "Lowpass filter" is not affected by this. That applies filtering to the final
  sound output.

* Added the ability to choose on screen message font.

* Added smooth animation (aka interframe blending with motion blurring). Makes 
  the output image a little realistic and closer to TV.

* Added ".md" extension to the ROM loading stuff.


Version 0.97
------------

* Preliminary Genesis/Megadrive VDP Mode 4 (SMS mode) support. Although there is no game that
  uses it, I've been asked by many homebrew developers/hackers to add support for this.
  Note that Mode 4 in MD is a bit different than in SMS. These little details are detailed
  in Charles MacDonald's SMS/MD docs. Due to time contraints, this feature isn't very havily
  tested so expect some bugs :) . Also note that this DOES NOT put the hardware in Mark III
  compatibility mode. The ports will still be unuseable.

* Hopefully fixed Sonic And Knuckles and other SRAM issues. The main problem is that I
  haven't been able to reproduce these problems at my end so thats why I can't be sure.

* Fixed Micro Machines 2 showing incorrect stage start screen when booth EEPROM and
  J-Cart are enabled.

* Hooked up EPPROM to some more games.

* Fixed Plan A/Window initialization bug. Thanks to Eke for reporting the bug (and fix!).

* Improved PSG. It should sound more accurate now. Levels have also been changed a bit.
  Thanks to Shadow for reporting very detailed bugs and information about it.
  
* Added support for RPI plugin scalers of 3x and 4x. Previoulsy Regen only supported 2x
  scaler, now it supports all of them. In short, all of Kega plugins will now work. :)

* Added the option to boost PSG noise to make some people happy :) .

* Added SMS border emulation.

* Improved SMS emulation. Should be more accurate now.

* Fixed "Output 4:3 aspect" not working in SMS games.

* Modified the NTSC filter plugin. Now you can instantly see the changes you make 
  (like Hue, Contrast etc..) in the NTSC configuration dialog.

* Removed the old on screen text display engine and added new one. The new one has the
  following advantages over the old one:
    
    - Support for Unicode.
    - Allows translation of the on-screen messages.
    - Works when fullscreen is enabled.
    - Hopefully doesn't have the problem of displaying garbage on some video cards.
  
* Added reconfigurable overdrive factor support. Previously, this was set to overdrive the final
  sound output by 2. Now yo can control is fom 1.0 to 5.0.
  
* Added featue to control the volume levels of FM and PSG separately. PSG Boost feature
  has been removed. This setting is mainly for those who are very picky about the volume
  levels between FM and PSG. But another factor in this is the game itself. Sound in
  some games may get clipped if the respective volume amplification is too much. So
  this needs a lot of tweaking before it can be used perfectly. My recommendation is
  to keep the settings between 1 and 2.5 and then use the overdrive factor setting to
  further amplify the sound.

* Scanlines effects added. Four predefined settings are given (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%).
  There is also the option to set the intensity to whatever value you want (for example 12%).
  Note however that the predefined scanlines setting are much faster than custom one.
  So its foolish to set custom intesity at 50% for example.

* Added "Power Saving mode" to increase laptop/notebook/netbook battery life while playing.
  In this mode, Regen won't use 100% CPU. But this can cause a little bit of jumpiness in FPS/video.
  
* Removed picture being a bit blurry even if nearst neighbour filter was selected (in non-stretch mode).
  Strecthing will still cause blurrines however.
  
* Fixed palette problem when brighten was enabled in Game Gear games. Note that brighten 
  may not have much of an effect on Game Gear games since the dynamic, extrapolated 
  color range of Game Gear is close to 16-bit 565 colors.
  
* Added support to take screenshots in PNG format. This setting can be controlled in
  "Paths and Preferences" dialog. Support for taking screenshot in BMP is still present.

* Fixed support for 12-in-1 and 4-in-1 cartridges.

* Added support for following unlicensed games:
  
    - Super Mario 2 1998
    - Super Mario Bros.
    - King of Fighter 98
    - Super 19-in-1
    - Super 15-in-1

* Changed the detection of unlicensed games. Now you need to disable "Autofix Checksum"
  in order for unlicensed games to work.

* Fixed cheat editor bug in "Cheats" dialog. Previously, it would ask for more values
  than required.
  
* Fixed BallZ 3D locking up by default.

* Fixed Regen crashing when editing cheats in the "Cheats" dialog by double-clicking
  an empty place.
  
* SuperHQ option now works at whatever sound rate is selected. This means it is now
  supported by both 44100 and 48000 output sampling rates.

* Fixed cheat searching. Newly searched and added cheats now work. After adding
  a newly found cheat, they will appear in the "Cheats" dialog. After being added,
  they are turned on by default. 

* Removed support for reconfigurable shortcuts using the INI. But you can still 
  reconfigure shortcuts using another way. See the next change :) .

* Fixed bugs related to brighten. In some games, enabling disabling birghten would
  cause some colors to turn black.
  
* Completely new localization support. Now, you not only translate the menus but
  translate the dialogs, message box text and even the on screen text to your
  language. Using this, you can also reconfigure the shortcuts. See "Localization.txt"
  in "Languages" subdirectory to see how to translate.
  
* Added "Alternate Timing" mode. This will fix jumpy FPS/stuttering video/audio 
  for some poeple.
  
* Corrected mid-frame CRAM writes handling. Mega Turrican's background sky gradient
  is now displayed properly.
  
* Added option to increase ROM space from 4 MB to 8 MB. This can only be changed by
  modifying the INI file and setting "LargeROMSpace" setting to "1" (LargeROMSpace = 1).
  
* Heavily refined path configuration dialog. Also contains other preferences as well
  so it has been renamed to "Paths and Preferences".

* Fixed up UPS patching support. Now it works (finally). If you click "System->Patch",
  it will first search for a corresponding UPS patch in the configured Patch directory
  and apply that patch. If not found, it will give UPS patch selection dialog to select
  some patch. For automatic searching of patches, the UPS patches must be of the same name
  as the ROM file but with a ".ups" extension.

* Option to automatically patch up a ROM if a corresponding UPS patch is found in the
  configured patches directory. If it is not found, it does *NOT* pop up an error message
  and will silently continue the game UNPATCHED. It was done because popping an error upon
  loading of every game without a patch is rather annoying. For automatic searching of patches, 
  the UPS patches must be of the same name as the ROM file but with a ".ups" extension.
  
* Option to ignore the CRC errors that were encountered during the patching of ROM.

* Added feature to enable/disable the autoamtic loading of cheat files.

* Small refinement to the menus. The menu items which start a dialog box now end with "...".

* Improvements to the command line and drag-drop code. Now its case insensitive and now
  you can load SMS/GG files by drag-dropping.
  
* Fixed the bug whereby loading a SMS game with fullscreen option given on the command line
  didn't go into fullscreen.
  
* Added support for SMS cheats. Note that only hex cheats are supported.

* Added ROM browser. Now you select the file inside 7z/Zip archives.

* Fixed a bug whereby loading a game after another caused the new game to be ran at the
  refresh rate of the previous game. This caused problems when, for example, one loaded
  PAL game after NTSC or vice versa.
  
* Fixed a bug which would caused Sonic Crackers to crash Regen while it locked up the hardware.

* Fixed a bug which caused a system lock up by a previously loaded game to not clear up while
  loading a new ROM.
  
* Input recording and replaying feature. Now you can record movies in Regen record format.
  Then you can exchange movies with other users. But most importantly, you can now record 
  the movie without lagging and then later replay it in Regen while re-recording it as an AVI,
  to upload it on video sites like Youtube etc..
  
* Added option to slow down emulation speed. Various speed settings are also given.
  From 3% to 100% settings. Useful for TASing.

* Added frame advance feature to the menu item. This feature was present in many previous
  versions as well but people are too lazy to read the manuals and asked me to add it when it
  is already there.

* Added links to docs and some important websites to the "Help" menu.

* Some other stuff as well which now I've forgotten >_> .

* Now with a serious Read Me. :D

Debugger Build:
***************
Most of these bugs reports and suggestions were made by Wiz and BigNailCow from
Shinning Force II (and Sonic) hacking scene. A few of the requested couldn't be
added becuase of my laziness. Sorry :) .

* Added spectrum analyzer. Useful for some music makers and it just looks damn cool :D .

* Fixed overclocking feature which got broken in 0.95.

* Fixed mismatch between displayed PC and the starting PC in diassesmbly window after pressing
  any of the stepping buttons.
  
* Now the 68000 debugger shows the exact address of breaking when breaking using "Breakpoint Range" mode.

* Fixed YM2612 debugger bug where Sustain level was being displayed as Release rate (Thanks to Tiido for reporting).

* Added "Go to Address" feature in the ROM browser to go to a specific address.

* Added tracing feature to the 68k debugger. Its a bit unstable right now but traces are created
  perfectly (but may cause Regen to crash sometimes). So its recommended to create a savestate before
  using that feature. Tracing will make Regen very slow and if you don't know how to use it correctly, you will
  find yourself running out of hard disk space :P.
  
* Made VDP layer selection dialog non-modal.


Version 0.96
------------

* A little limitation of vcell scrolling emulated correctly. Thanks to
  Steve Snake for detailed info on this. (F1 World Champioship, Kawasaki
  Challenge use this)
  
* Changed the YM2413 emulator a little. Should sound more accurate.
  (After Burner 2, Ys (J) etc..)
  
* Many new YM2612 improvements and upates. Thanks to the new research and testing
  by Nemesis.

* Sprite masking bug in Mickey Mania fixed.

* Many improvements to renderer. Now passes all of the sprite masking and limitations
  tests.

* Cheats fixed.

* Palette select bit emulated. Sik's ROM fucks up correctly now :P .

* Completely overhauled Z80 handling and emulation. RAZE has been removed.
  It has been tested quite heavily alongside the real thing by Tiido and 
  is very close to the real hardware now. But this has made emulator a bit 
  slow as well. My thanks goes to Tiido for testing this. ;)
  
* Fixed lightgun support which got broken in 0.95

* Option added to remove flickering while in interlacing mode.

* Fixed AVI recording.

* Improved stability and crashes (hopefully).

* Option added to force the output image aspect to be 4:3 (which the real hardware does).
  In this mode, games with 256 pixels width will be scaled to 320.
  
* Ability to load SMS/GG ROMs from the command line.


Version 0.95
------------
The release took quite a while because I've been getting very less time to
work on it. The changes of 0.93 "Beta" releases have been merged in it since
this is a proper release after 0.85. This release should be more accurate than
EVER. Though I am not making any claims ;) .

* Preliminary Sega Master System, GameGear, SG-1000, SC3000 support.
  It should be *very* accurate. I've also spent lot of time making it fast.

  Firstly, the SMS/GG/SG/SC emulation is based on docs and various posts on
  SMSPower by Charles MacDonald and others. Some things were figured out from
  MEKA. So don't forget to thank Charles MacDonald and Omar Cornut because;
  of the amount of information they make avaiable (especially Charles),
  you'd better have a good excuse for writing inaccurate emulator for
  these machines :D .
  
  Secondly, SMS/GG/SC/SG emulation uses Z80 emulator by Juergen Buchmueller because
  it contains correct implmentation of some undocumented/obscure behaviour needed
  by some games (for example, Rambo III). And I wasn't going to spend time
  on fixing RAZE which I could spend on something else. So thanks goes out to 
  Juergen Buchmueller for his accurate Z80 emulator. RAZE is still used in 
  Genesis emulation though.
  
  Thirdly, nearly everything that I knew of (read: could find documented) is
  supported!!. This includes stuff like BIOS, paddles, lightgun, sports pads,
  3D glasses (simulated) etc... Let me know if I missed anything and I'll add it. 
  
  Finally, I would like to thank Eke. A modified ROM database of games requiring
  special handling (mappers, devices etc...) was taken from his Wii/GameCube port of 
  smsplus. Region detection and some header related things were also figured out from
  there. Due to all this, I was able to very quickly test and debug support for those
  games which otherwise would've taken me weeks or even months. Thanks again Eke :) .

* Very significant VDP timing changes. It should be more accurate than ever. DMA and FIFO
  part was also rewritten completely. All games SHOULD now run flawlessly but I guess we'll
  see.
  
* Many Z80 interrupt handling related changes. Fixes missing sound in WaterWorld and
  should fix incorrect sound in some others (eg Flashback).

* New FIR resampler. 

  This resampler is written by the awesome Shay Green aka blargg
  and is very high quality (more than linear interpolation which was used previously).
  As a result, sound is more better. Also thanks to him for getting it working in Regen.

* Window sizes *should* be correct now.

* Shortened the ReadMe file quite a bit so that people can actually try and read it :D .

* UPS patch support will be completely (re)broken it this release. I wanted to integrate it a bit
  more tightly but due to the lack of time I couldn't :( . So I have disabled it.
  
* Again, due to the lack of time, I couldn't complete my new multi-language support.
  But fortunately, old system has been put back again.
  
* Due to some new code, I was unable to apply compiler optimizations to a critical
  part of code without breaking it. So this release may be quite a bit slower.
  Damn you MSVC!!!

* Implemented frequency counter overflow bug.

  This finally fixes the one instrument in Ariel, Shaq-Fu, Spider-Man: The
  Animated Series, Scooby-Doo Mysteries, etc. Thanks go to Nemesis.
  Fixed only in SuperHQ mode.

* Added SSG-EG support to the YM2612 core.

  Thanks go out to Jarek Burczynski, Tatsuyuki Satoh and Nemesis. 
  Surprisingly, more games use it than I thought. It is used by Alisia's Dragon,
  Asterix, GhostBusters, Buba N Stix, Top Gear 2 etc.
  I am sure there many more games that are using it.
  
* Fixed sound in Spiderman And Venom - Separation Anxiety, Indiana Jones and the Last
  Crusade, Doom Troopers + some others. Thanks to a Russian guy who wants to remain 
  anonymous for reporting these problems.

* YM2612 envelope generator now gets updated at approximately every 2.43 cycle.

* Added correct CSM mode support. Thanks to Nemesis again.

* Fixed the poping/crackling in many games (Sonic 1/2/3, Urban Strike etc...). Turned
  out be a problem in YM2612 core. I thought it was the Z80 interrupt timings.
  
* Implmented cycle accurate sample generation.Thanks to Eke and Nemesis for help in this.
  Fast DAC in some games is now fixed and all games now sound more accurate, 
  clean and better.
  
* Improved PSG noise emulation. Thanks to Maxim's docs and HardWareMan, Eep386.
  Listen to Robocop vs. Terminator.
  
* Also corrected the PSG levels compared to YM2612 (hopefully). But I don't think
  they are correct. It seems that PSG (especially noise) volumes get very high
  sometimes. For example in WWF Arcade Game at character selection screen, the noise
  volume level is very high in the a real Megadrive whereas in Regen (and all other
  emus for that matter) it is about three to four times lower(?).

* Fixed Combat Cars two player mode screen.

* Optimized the YM2612 core resulting in nice speed increase.

* Optimized the VDP rendering code resulting in another good speed increase.

* Konami Justifier support. Thanks to Eke.

* Fixed sound in some Chinese games. GoodGen lists them unknown. But they look
  very nice.

* Fixed Time Killers and Onslaught lock-ups.

* Fixed Ya-Se Chuanshuo.

* Removed the old debugger and added many new debuggers in its place which are
  more better and powerful. All the debuggers are based on a special Gens Tracer
  mod by Yakovlev Victor. Thanks.
  
* Improved 6-button pad support a bit. Fixes controls in Mortal Kombat.

* Fixed Menacer support. The only game that I know of which uses this is Menacer
  6-in-1 and it requires the Menacer to be plugged into port two. Capture
  and release the mouse with F7 (default).

* Added overclocking support (68k only). The setting is not saved. Takes
  effect immediately. Will break timing sensitive games for sure.
  
* Fixed a small bug in VDP timing which would cause a one line glitch at 
  the bottom in Lotus 2, Kawasaki Challenge and some others.
  
* Fixed flickering in Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel.

* Fixed sound in Stargate, Batman Forever, Judge Dredd and maybe some more games.

* Implemented ROM/RAM switching support. Needed in Sonic 3 & Knuckles,
  Phantasy Star 4 and Story of Thor.
  
* Complete rewrite of the frontend timing/synchronization code. 
  It has the following advantages:
	
	- No periodic sound skips anymore.
	- VSync should now work better and work on more PCs. PAL games too shouldn't have stutters anymore.
	- It is very fast.
	- No emulation hiccups
	- Regen is now much more responsive
  
* Debugger disassembly fixed.

* DAC sound in Mega Turrican and some others fixed.

* Changed VDP timings a bit. This fixes Streets of Rage intro not showing up.

* Fixed lots of buffer overflows and memory leaks in my YM2612 core. Now Mega Turrican
  track 2 doesn't create a stack overflow which was present in the beta :) .

* Added Hue, Saturation etc.. controls to NTSC filter plugin.
  Note that configuration dialog box will only appear when some game is running.
  
* Added a tiny cheat editor. Double click on a cheat to open it. Note that modified
  cheats are not saved. Also, multi address cheats are not supported yet.

* Improved region detection a bit.

* Fixed a nasty bug in the save state code which was casuing loading of states to completely
  fail sometimes.
  
* Fixed command line bugs. It should now work perfectly.

* Added the ability to set fullscreen from command line. The syntax is:

	"regen --fullscreen path_to_ROM"

* FPS display is now more precise and more frequently updated.

* Fixed "Save state as.." saving without any extension.

* Added lightgun cursor support. This is only meant for Justifier games. It may
  not work correctly with Menacer.

* Automatically load cheat file based upon naming of the game. Otherwise the usual
  open file dialog will appear.
  
  For example if you loaded the game "Sonic and Knuckles & Sonic 3 (W) [!].zip", 
  then if there is a file called "Sonic and Knuckles & Sonic 3 (W) [!].dat" in
  the configurable cheats directory, it will be loaded automatically.
  
* Fixed the bug when someone pressed Alt + Enter twice to get out of fullscreen.

* Fixed a bug when J-Cart was set (had to be disabled from ini file).

* Fixed brighten/enhanced feature. It is now saved as well.

* Hopefully fixed starting directory problems when loading a ROM. Because of this
  LastROM entry has been added in the config file.

* Regen does not close if loading of a ROM failed.

* Regen is now linked with MSLU library to make it work in Win9x.
  You will need unicows.dll. The startup time will be a bit slower on
  WinXP and above than previously.

* Hopefully fixed the bugs with the lowpass filter.

* Regen does not use 100% CPU while paused.

* Regen is now compatible with WinXP visual styles.

* AVI recording is broken for now due to new sync code.

* New style changelog file which is more readable and pleasant to the eyes :). Thanks to Adam.

* A lot more changes than listed here and now I've forgotten. Specially in between the betas.


Version 0.85
------------

  Well, this release may not look much different from previous (0.77) one but believe
  me there have been many, many changes. Two major emulation subsystems have been totally
  replaced with new ones. They are the timing and event system and the second being the
  new YM2612 core. There were many betas released to make sure every game worked correctly
  and more accurately than ever. Though it’s true that I haven't implemented some front-end
  related feature requests because I didn't wanted to delay this release any longer.
  I am sorry for that.


* Totally rewrote timing code and implemented a new event system.

  I think this new code is very close to being 100% accurate. Although Regen still
  emulates line-by-line this code will give results that can only be achieved by running
  the emulator cycle-by-cycle. This code is not slow either. In fact, it may be faster
  than the previous code. This code is still in early stages but I thought it was stable
  enough to released. Now why I did it? Especially since the previous system was already
  very mature. Well the only *real* reason for me was that a user posted me a small demo
  program that will only run correctly if the timings of the emulator were absolutely
  perfect. So, as you may have guessed, that it did not work correctly under Regen.
  But the interesting thing is that it did not work correctly in Kega either. Fixing
  the demo broke many other games. But with this new system not only the demo works
  correctly but also all the games work perfect (as far as I've tested).

  This new system has also fixed some games that did not work previously which include:

	- Bram Stoker's Dracula
	- Wheel of Fortune

  It also fixes some of the glitches in games like Legends of Galahad, Nigel Mansell's
  World Championship Racing, Striker, Deadly Moves (runs even better than Kega) and many more.

* Replaced MAME's FM core with my own YM2612 emulator which I had been working on for some
  time. This is the reason this release took so long. It more accurate than MAME's core
  and very close to real thing. Listen to Warlock, Ariel, Shaq Fu etc. for the difference.
  If a game still doesn't sound correctly please report it.

* Changed 68k timings. This fixes Surging Aura.

* Sound in Pac-Man 2, The New Adventures (U) fixed. Maybe the first time for any Genesis
  emulator. I couldn't find any other emu that runs it correctly.

* Corrected the behavior of X-MEN 2 and Eternal Champions on reset.

* Fixed the PAR finally this time. All the codes will now work Regen that worked in
  Kega and real hardware.

* Added multi-language support to Regen menus.

  There are many languages available by default. Thanks to their authors. See the
  respective language files for their names. You can create your own language file too.
  See the readme for that. Please note that there won't be any check beside any selected
  language. That is because I noticed the list changes on every run of Regen even if no
  new languages are installed. This creates the problem of check appearing against wrong
  language. There are solutions to it but its just too much pain.

* Changed the drop list height in redefine keys dialog so that 6-button, Menacer, Sega Mouse
  options are visible. People thought Regen didn't support them :-)

* Regen will now correctly load Kega and Gens' created SRAM files.

* Now you can pause a game then press space for executing just one frame. Useful for taking
  precise screenshots.

* Fixed and improved the EEPROM support. All games that *did* have EEPROM originally will
  run correctly now.

* Fixed a small glitch in country sub menu.

* Multiple messages can now be displayed.

* Added a small program in "Fonts" directory to create fonts for the emulator text engine.

  Please note that it will ask twice to select font. The first will be used when
  'Superfast Rendering' or 'None' is selected. The second will be used when a plugin is
  selected and is usually the same as the first one but nearly twice the size. I could do it
  programmatically but I didn't because this way the user can tweak the sizes individually
  because the second font doesn't appear to be exactly twice the size (little bigger) even
  the height is exactly the twice of the first one.

* AVI movie recording support. Don't ask for any other format please.
  Recording directory is same as sound.

* Loading a game multiple times will create only one entry in the File History.

* Fixed FPS display being cut-off if in three or more digits in None plugin mode.

* Fixed some crashes especially when changing the sound rate.

* New About box :) .

* Many other internal changes.


Version 0.77
-------------

* Implemented the highly requested "SuperHQ" option in sound settings.

  Enabling this will result in highly accurate sound and very close to real thing.
  But it will also slow down emulation so you must have a fast enough PC. Sound rate
  will automatically be set to 48000Hz. See Sonic 1, Sonic 3D intro, Vectorman intro,
  X-Men intro and nearly all games for the difference in accuracy and quality. I am
  trying to make it as accurate as Kega Fusion. And if you have something to tell me
  about YM2612, it is highly welcomed :-). Do tell me if it is still inaccurate
  including the game in which it sounds wrong.

* WAV dumping modified so that it works correctly in SuperHQ mode.

* Rewrote major part of DirectSound code to fix the static in sound on some computers.

* No need to restart the emulator after changing sound rate.

* Changed 68k timings a bit. Fixes "California Games".

* Improved VDP write timings. Fixes Double Clutch menu (no flickering anymore).

* This time really fixed the sprite masking code. Fixes sprites appearing above HUD
  in Vectorman and Streets of Rage.

* Improved VBLANK timings which fix X-perts.

* Updated SVP emulator.

* Following unlicensed games are now supported. As always Autofix Checksum must
  be enabled:

	- Lion King 3
	- Super King Kong 99

* Fixed the following reported bugs:

	- Regen crashing if "Brighten" enabled without any game loaded.
	- Backspace key not working to toggle Turbo Mode.
	- Cheats not being unloaded when loading a game after another game.
	- Hard/soft reset, power off crashing emulator when no game is loaded.
	- Having sound disabled for most of the game until you reactivate it,
          doesn't re-enable sound.
	- Using the taskbar button for Regen doesn't always autopause gameplay.
          It keeps on playing minimized.
	- Regen doesn't create SRM files properly if you load new game without power
          offing previous running game.
	- Country submenu not setting the right region.


Version 0.7
------------

  I had some more features to add than these but due to university work I could not
  complete them and I had to save some things to do in 0.8 :)


* Fixed a problem in sprite masking code. Fixes sprites in Castle of Illusion
  appearing above the window plane.

* Fixed sprite problems in Contra - Hard Corps.

* Added preliminary FIFO and its timing (VDP write latency) emulation.

  Menu in Double Clutch is now correct (but flickers) and The Chaos Engine runs
  perfect (no flickering on scroll). It was reported by Eke and he also helped
  in fixing it.Thanks.

* Fixed corrupted games when loaded after Virtua Racing.

* Improved DMA timings (Sonic 3D intro).

* Added 7zip support. Only the first file in it will be loaded.

* Added support to redefine menu shortcuts.

* Regen now remembers last ROM path.

* Rewrote major part of DirectInput code to fix some controller issues.
  All controller related issues should be gone.

* Selecting a window size now has a little check by the selection.

* The "Off" options are now highlighted when loading cheats.

* Default directories for BIOS (system dependant), SRM, BRM, Save States,
  Screenshots, etc. 

* Configuration settings for the various settings and paths to BIOS/various
  directories (like Kega). 

* Added option to brighten the screen (like Kega). But there is no support to save it
  because it is not correct for all the games (especially the games with Shadow/Highlight
  effects).

* Following unlicensed games now run correctly, still many more to come:

	- Soul Blade
	- 12-in-1
	- 4-in-1
	- Smart Mouse

* Regen will now create the default directories and will show a small message box when it’s
  ran for the first time.

* Added a special keyword to the cheat files called "Default" this will auto-enable cheat
  options. For example:

	 [3] 
	 Name=Infinite Lives
	 0=Off
	 1=On
	 Default=1
	 
  This will enable the second option (since counting from zero) for this cheat.

* Added option to reload the cheat file in cheats dialog box. I did this because my cheat
  editor was very buggy and did not save the cheat file correctly. Now the user can easily
  edit the cheat code with their favorite editor and reload the cheat file instantly.
  Note that all the enabled cheats will revert back to being off except those which were
  auto-enabled with the special "Default" keyword.

* When there is no history to be displayed, nothing appears when hovering over the
  File History sub-menu. 

* Fixed "Disable menu shortcuts" option.

* Fixed "Reset to default keys" option.

* Fixed a minor bug in command line code.

* Option to shorten the path in the history to game name only. Only changeable through
  the ini file by setting ShortHistoryNames to 1.

* Removed the empty file history slots when less than 5 games have been played. 

* Cheat Window is a bit bigger now (on request).

* Fixed Port 2 controller being saved on Port 1d, and possibly others.

* Fixed buzzing sounds when disabling sound mid-game.

* Netplay option has been disabled in this release because it was way too buggy.

* Text engine uses a bit smaller font.

* Regen now directly creates and sizes itself to the last position instead of creating
  at center and moving to the last window place or resizing itself.

* Minor fixes and tweaks.

* Many, many, MANY new cheat files added (thanks to King of Chaos).

* Fixed many typos in the ReadMe file. Thanks to Adam.

* Some more things which I forgot.


Version 0.6
-----------

* Changed the Z-80 emulator from MZ-80 to RAZE as this is much more accurate and since
  MZ-80 was having some problems with some games. If you find some games broken report
  them.

* Updated M68K core to latest version as a result debugger disassembly is broken for now.

* Added highly customizable and fast text engine. You can change the text color from the
  ini file by modifying TextColor_R, TextColor_G, TextColor_B values. Option to make and
  change fonts will be added later.

* Option to show framerate.

* Added my own pixel doubling (non-anti-aliased) and interpolation filter plugins.

* Added option to not emulate console lock-ups. These are not emulated by default.
  You can emulate them by setting EmulateLockups variable to 1 in the ini file.

* Changed the name of "Superfast blitting" to "Superfast rendering" as this is right.

* SRAM and EEPROM saving and loading added. Maybe incorrect, I couldn't test it much.
  You can disable their loading and saving from the "System" menu.

* WAV logging added. VGM logging will be added soon. The directory where the sound will be
  dumped can be specified in the ini file by changing the SoundDumpDir variable.

* Made Super Street Fighter II working. You must disable autofix checksum for it to work.

* Tried to improve the PAR support. I couldn't test it much. Tell me how it goes.

* Regen can now fool the "Emulator Detector" program made by Tiido. It can detect if his
  program is being run on real Genesis or on an emulator. I could not find any emulator that
  is capable of fooling it, not even Kega.

* Following unlicensed games added, more to come soon:

	- Super Bubble Bobble
	- Earth Defend
	- Whac-A-Critter / Mallet Legend 
	- Funny World And Balloon Boy
	- Squirrel King
	- A Bugs Life (Autofix checksum must be disabled for this game to work)

* Fixed the following bugs (mostly reported by ZSNES forum members):

	- Sprites showing up in Battle Tech start when they shouldn't be. Thanks to Eke for
          reporting this problem and telling the solution too :-)
	- Sound problems in Sonic 2.
	- Loading another game past Virtua Racing causes the graphics to be messed up.
	- Loading another game from history when Virtua Racing is loading causes the emulator
          to crash.
	- Does not mute sound when lost focus.
	- Once a cheat is enabled, you can't change the state if it's a multi-option cheat. 
          (E.g. Sonic 1 chaos emerald modifier, can't change from six to five, always goes back
          to six). 

* Hopefully fixed (or at least minimized) the static in sound when window is moved.

* The following things are still unfixed due to some valid reasons :-)

	- Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy. AFAIK it’s a hack. I don't like to add hacked games
          that need special handling. But if there are enough people who would like to see it on
          Regen then I will add it. Currently there have been just 2 requests :)
	- No autopause if minimized using taskbar button. Windows reports that Regen has the focus.
          I could not find any emulator, with autopause option, that autopaused this way.
	- Save states in Virtua Racing. Genecyst savestate format currently does not allow extra
          stuff to be saved. It needs to be extended.
	- Game no Kanzume o Tokuyou won't run. It wants to write to ROM and also seems to use
          unused VDP control bits.
	  I have not found *right*(read without hack) way to run this game.
	- Wonder Library will also not run. Is it really a Genesis game?? Seems to be a SegaCD
          game. It does lots of unused memory read/writes in the SegaCD area.


Version 0.5
-----------

* DMA timings implemented. This fixes the following:

	- Single line at bottom in Virtua Racing.
	- DAC in Virtua Racing now runs correctly.
	- Legends of Galahad bottom screen.
	- Formula 1 and Kawasaki Challenge bottom screen.
	- Insector X intro being too fast.
	- Many others

* Autofix checksum option added. Note that fixing checksum might break some games.

* Improved YM2612 emulation again.

* Serial EEPROM emulation added. Huge thanks to Eke for his very good documentation
  on this.

* Added Hex code and PAR (Pro Action Replay) cheat code support to cheat engine.
  All codes working in Kega should work.

* Fixed the following bugs (taken directly from the Regen topic in ZSNES forums,
  thanks to King of Chaos):

	- Clicking Disable Sound without game loaded can cause the emulator
          to crash.
	- The setting for disabling sound (and other settings) isn't saved
          sometimes. 
	- Editing the Disable Sound setting in the INI doesn't disable the
          sound, trying to disable it crashes the emulator. 
	- Clear History sometimes doesn't work, unless you click it several times. 
	- Clicking on an empty history slot will crash the emulator. 
	- ROMs bigger than the 4MB Genesis limit (e.g Super Street Fighter II)
          causes the emulator to crash. 
	- No selection for Gamepad under Use in the controller configuration. 
	- When you change games, you can't load in a new cheat file for the new game. 
	- When you "power off" the emulator, you can still activate cheats,
          no "No game loaded" dialog. 
	- No checkboxes for the selected Sound Rate, so you don't know which one
          you're using. 
	- System > Country > Auto Detect does not have a check by it when selected.

* Some unlicensed game support. The following unlicensed games are supported right now
  more will be added later, huge thanks to Haze (David Haywood):

	- Lion King II
	- Elf Wor
	- Mahjong Lover

* Emulation of system lock-up on illegal address access. Now Sonic Crackers hangs just
  like in reality.


Version 0.41
------------

  This is just a quick update because of a small mistake I made.


* Forgot to uncomment a line of code which made Mega Man (possibly others) break.

* As a bonus I included the Sesame Street fix too :-).


Version 0.4
-----------

  Note:
  Massive changes were done regarding interrupt handling which may have
  resulted in some games being broken from the previous version.
  If you find one do tell me.


* All accuracy hindering things have been removed from this release. Because of this,
  this version will be slower (read very slow) than the previous one.

* Aggressive interrupt checking.

* Sprite collision and overflow flags now implemented (needed by Shadow of the Beast,
  Strider 2).

* Changed Musashi's interrupt handling. This fixes Lemmings status bar.

* SRAM support added. Many games needed this to work properly (Dragon Slayer, NHL 96 etc.).
  No support to save it though.

* Dino Dini Soccer runs perfectly now. Even more accurate than Kega Fusion and Gens!

* DAC now works in Virtua Racing but is not correct.

* Fatal Rewind lockup fixed.

* Double Dragon 2 lockup fixed.

* 68000 Debugger enabled. This was the most requested feature!
  It might be buggy though :-)

* Stretch option added.

* Option added in NTSC filer to disable scanlines.

* Incorrect screenshots fixed.

* Command line support. Only supports loading of games right now.

* Clear history fixed

* Regen now remembers window position.

* Fixed sound pausing on window move while a game is running.

* Other minor tweaks and fix-ups.


Version 0.3
-----------

* Preliminary SVP emulation added. Thanks to notaz and TascoDeluxe.
  Although now Virtua Racing is playable but the DAC won't run (strange).

* SoundBufferSize option added to ini file. Default value is 7 because
  that worked best on my PC. If sound is skipping try playing with different
  values.

* DirectInput support

* 6-button pad, Teamplayer, 4-way play, lightgun, sega mouse, J-Cart
  support (all preliminary)

* Sonic 3D bonus stage fixed (got broken in previous version)

* Captain planet screen fixed

* Further FM emulator improvements. Sound should be a bit more accurate. For an example
  see Sonic 3 Chaos emerald stages as he picks the balls. It sounds more close to Kega
  now than previously.

* FM timers fixed in FM emulator. This fixes sound in some games. Thanks to Eke.

* Single line glitches in many games fixed (Road rash 1, 2 etc ...)

* Mouse capture/release using F12. This is used for Menacer Lightgun and Sega Mouse.

* Many more games now work (Super Kick Off, etc.).

* Drag and drop file support.

* Added joypad support. Since I don't have any gamepads I can not tell if it will work.
  It is just based on estimation.

* Fixed Z80 interrupt timing (again). This fixes slow or missing music from some games.


Version 0.2
------------

* Modified FM emulator slightly. It should sounds a bit more accurate now.

* Fixed sound timing problems with games.

* Due to above "Apply timing fix" option now removed

* Fixed some frontend problems that some users reported

* Fixed savestates. They should load correctly now.

* A few tweaks.

* ScreenShotDir option added to the ini file


Version 0.01
------------

* Renderer rewrite. Most things implemented.

* VDP rewrite with H/V counter thanks to Gens and Genesis Plus.

* Tatsuyuki Satoh's YM2612 emulator added.

* DSound added.

* Added PAL timing.

* Improved sync between 68k and Z80. As a result many games work now but still
  some sound issues.

* Added "Apply timing fix" option to fix sound in some games because of interrupts
  firing too closely. This makes sound in some games a bit fast.

* Added country selection, domestic, overseas things.

* Some sprite problems fixed. Thanks to TascoDLX.

* Some usual frontend things added.

* Kega Fusion plugin support.

* Savestates support, loading still incorrect.

* Changed memory handlers from "ifs” to "switch".

* Many, many other things.


Version 0.001 [unreleased]
--------------------------

* Everything is new

* Basic VDP added

* Basic renderer. No shadow/highlight support. No interlace support.
  No limitations implemented.

* No sound

* Just enough to make some games work.
